# Z model of a Disk Imager

This repository contains the project that I made as part of my final year project at the University of York titled Formal Methods for Forensic Tools.

The objective of this project was to ascertain the usefulness of formally modelling basic tools used during investigations. In this case, it was a Disk Imager that works on a FAT file structure.
