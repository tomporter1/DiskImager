The three types of devices that imaging can be done in
deadbox - the device remains unchanged throught the image creation
pTwo - the device may have been changed during this process. It is not known how much of the data has been changed
remote - the data is on something like a server so NON of the data is origional

drives map a dirve to a releation that maps a sequence of sectors. The position in the sequence is the address for that sector
images is the new disk images that will be created
changed releates the drives to the addresses that have been changed when extracting the data
---
all drives will be in changed (if they are unchanged then they will point to an empty set)
deadboxes have no address that have been changed
pTwo and remote devices can have any number of addresses changed
